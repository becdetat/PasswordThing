Password Thing

A HTML 5 based web app for storing usernames and passwords in the local database.

This project uses jQuery Mobile (Alpha 2) for the user interface.

Basic backup and restore functionality is provided using Dropbox. A Dropbox account will need to be created. To connect to the Dropbox account, in Options select Get Dropbox Token and log in.

This has been tested in Chrome and an iOS 4 iPod only. There are some issues with rendering that may be partly due to jQuery Mobile still being in alpha.
