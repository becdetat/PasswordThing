*Password Thing*

A HTML 5 based web app for storing usernames and passwords in the local
database.

This project uses [jQuery Mobile][1] (Alpha 2) for the user interface.
Currently jQuery
Mobile is delivered via a CDN, once a stable version has been released I will
bundle it with the app.

I'm planning to include backup to a Dropbox account for off-device storage in
a later version.

This has been tested in Chrome and an iOS 4 iPad only. There are some issues
with rendering that may be partly due to jQuery Mobile still being in alpha.
