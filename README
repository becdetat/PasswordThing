Password Thing

A HTML 5 based web app for storing usernames and passwords in the local
database.

This project uses jQuery Mobile (Alpha 2) for the user interface.

I'm planning to include backup to a Dropbox account for off-device storage in
a later version.

This has been tested in Chrome and an iOS 4 iPod only. There are some issues
with rendering that may be partly due to jQuery Mobile still being in alpha.
